Welcome to **Kick Code Coffee**! A fun and personal portfolio site where I combine my love for **code**, **martial arts**, and **pop culture**. It's a casual space to showcase the other side of me beyond the resume.

## üî• What's Inside

- My hobbies, interests, and fun facts about me
- Clean HTML, CSS (and optional JavaScript) structure
- Lightweight, fast, and hosted on GitHub Pages

## üß† Why This Exists

While [**dev-yama.com**](https://www.dev-yama.com) is my main portfolio focused on professional experience and projects, this site was built as a side project while I was improving my **frontend skills with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**. It's a creative outlet where I could code freely, explore ideas, and show a more personal and expressive side of myself, including my love for **Star Wars**, anime, and martial arts.
